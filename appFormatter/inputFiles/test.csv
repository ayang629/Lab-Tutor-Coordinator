As a student having attended many lab sessions hosted by a variety of tutors, I've noticed that as a lab tutor, you can only help students to a certain extent, where you can't give too much away and help students directly with the problem. As a classmate, it's much more informal where students help each other directly with the problem and code, whereas as a tutor you must restrict yourself from that (except in the case of debugging).

3/2/16 17:37,Robert ,Robert,Mcarthur,mcarthur,53814230,2019,Computer Science,4,4,Yes,No,"In high school, I tutored students in the after school program at Churchill Middle School in math and science. I worked with various types of students - some who were academically gifted and some who really struggled. I remember one student in particular who was in the 6th grade, yet struggled to perform simple arithmetic. Working with him every week was especially challenging because he struggled to focus, his thoughts wandered, and often times he was more interested in telling me about his video games than finishing his homework. On the days that I wasn't there, he usually never did his homework, but when I was there to help him, he could actually get some of his homework done, which was almost a miracle for this student. Working with him and the fact that he looked forward to seeing me every week was probably the most rewarding part of tutoring at Churchill. Because I was also a member of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), I would teach workshops at Churchill about business, entrepreneurship, and personal finance in a fun and interactive way (mostly through mock game shows). I competed at the national level for FBLA in the personal finance competition, and so I really wanted to share my knowledge with those around me. I believe it's never too early to start learning about topics like that. Whenever I gave these workshops I was always astounded at the level of student engagement. Because of this, I have realized that I can learn so much about something and get better at it by teaching it, and so I want to apply that idea to my computer science education by tutoring.","There are many instances in my academic career when I struggled to understand or do something, whether it was kinematics, calculus, or writing Chinese characters. One subject that I had a hard time grasping in particular was a philosophy class I had to take in high school called the Theory of Knowledge (TOK). I struggled in TOK because philosophy is not as concrete as the other subjects we study in high school. In that class, we often had to talk about the various ways in which we come to know what we know, and the different areas of knowledge that exist. To me, this was all very confusing, until I asked my teacher how knowledge is exactly defined. He then explained to me that knowledge is a justified true belief, so for something to be knowledge, somebody had to believe it, be able to justify it, and show that it was true. By breaking down the definition of knowledge for me, he took something that seemed very abstract and turned it into something I could understand. TOK was one of the most eye opening classes I have ever taken, thanks to the teacher I had. Once I had a working, concrete definition of knowledge, I understood the different areas of knowledge a whole lot better, and came to realize that there is more than one way of knowing and acquiring knowledge. Whenever I learn about something new, whether it's coding or history or mathematics, I always think about the different ways of acquiring knowledge that exist, and how those different ways benefit people with various learning styles. Some people learn better by reading, some by listening, and some by having others explain a topic to them, and that is something I am cognizant of and accommodating for when I am tutoring.","Before I came to UCI and took ICS 31, I had programming experience in Python. Because of this, my skill level tended to be a bit higher than that of my partners', and so whenever they were having trouble understanding something, I took the time to explain exactly what each line of code does. Whenever there was a bug in our program, I almost always was able to identify the problem and fix it. However, many people in ICS 31 take the class with no prior programming experience, so often times, partners cannot thoroughly and accurately explain how and why each line of code does what it does, and might not be able to identify what is causing errors in the program right away. Because of the frustration this can cause for new programmers, a classmate or lab partner might be tempted to simply tell someone what to type and move on without explaining why. I believe that a lab tutor should take a different approach. If a lab tutor helps someone find a bug or fix an error, they should explain why that error was happening and then guide the student to a solution, instead of simply telling them what to type and then walking away. Essentially, a lab tutor should not do the work for the student, but work with the student to help with what they need and be able to explain code thoroughly and accurately, as well as answer any questions the student has about python programming in general.

I feel like I'm able to help people where they need aid, which is beneficial for them.In college, I'm in a similar situation. I help my friends in a class that they're struggling with. It could be anywhere from Math 2A, 2B or even ICS 31, 32, 33. I'm confident that I know how to tutor in the 30 series.","When I was in high school, I thought my peer AP Calculus and AP Chemistry. I was always available to help them since I would benefit from the experience. I remember an instance where I understood the chain rule when my teacher in high school taught it, but a handful of my friends didn't. As a result, I would teach them in a classroom that one of my teachers allowed me to borrow during nutrition or lunch. I would constantly aid my peers in that class that it became a weekly routine, ""We're having a quiz on Thursday, so we better make sure we understand the material. Could you go over some problems Danilo?"" By doing that, I gained experience in helping my friends understand the subject.A similar situation happened in college. When I transitioned to college it was a rough start, but end with my first year, I was confident that I was underperforming and made it my goal to become a better programmer. It happened through the summer and I'm currently helping my friend in ICS 31 and 32. Looking back at it, it's completely different, mainly because the class is extremely simple to me now. Helping my friends out has benefited me since I have a better understanding in Python now. ","Well, a classmate may simply give the answer out to someone in lab. This would ruin the learning experience and I know for a fact that this ruined my experience in ICS 31. I didn't have the struggle of figuring something out, which drastically impacted me in 32. A tutor though, would guide the person to the right solution. Instead of simply giving out the answer, the tutor would explain the process of what does what. An example would be, a classmate giving someone a lambda function, but the receiver doesn't even understand what a lambda is, but doesn't bother asking for help because it works. A tutor on the other hand, would explain what a lambda is and guide them on how to write a proper one.",Yes,B-,"MW 8:00-9:50a (Lab 1), MW 2:00-3:50p (Lab 5)","I would just like to mention, my grade for ICS 31 was pathetic, but I know for a fact that I have a firm understanding of everything this course offers.
