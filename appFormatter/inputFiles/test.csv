3/5/2015 18:35,Christian,,Morte,cmorte,84698109,2018,Computer Science and Engineering,3.435,3.5,Yes,No,"One of my first experiences tutoring involved helping my little sister out in her homework. At home, I guided her through homework from math, English, and religion. In addition to homework, I made sure she was thoroughly prepared before important exams when my mom was not there to help out. These experiences taught me the value of making sure the tutee not just gets the answer, but understands the answer. Because my sister was only in primary school, I knew it was crucial that she masters the material so that she would have a good base for future learning.

During my senior year of high school, I became one of the teaching assistants for the ROP Video Production class. As a TA, I helped students out in any technical issues or general questions concerning the video project they were working on. After having previous knowledge in the software the class worked with (Adobe Premiere Pro), I was required to provide aid to any students who were confused with a certain tool in the program.","Before the AP Calculus exam, I sought tutoring from my teacher Hedlund. At first, I only cared about the answer to a problem than figuring out how to tackle through it. However, Hedlund taught me a valuable tool in improving a skill or learning something new: attention to detail. He made me look into every little element before doing a calculus problem such as writing down variables and creating a diagram than just tackling the question head on. It was through this that I understood the concept of thinking ahead and breaking a problem down into small pieces before actually doing it. Hedlund not only helped me successfully pass the AP Calculus test, but provided me an approach on how to solve future complex problems in other subjects.","As a classmate helping someone out in lab, one cares more about providing them with the solution to the problem. Classmates are more worried about getting the concept themselves than others understanding it. When a peer helps another peer out, the ultimate goal is to provide a quick solution and then go back to their own problems in the lab. For example, a classmate may just provide the student a part of code that allows the student in need to move forward. The student was provided help, but may not have fully understood what was going on or why it worked.

In contrast, the approach of giving support as a tutor involves making sure the person in need fully grasps the concept you are trying to teach. Being a tutor, you are almost an extension of the professor and a source of aid for the student. With that responsibility, a tutor must make sure that the student in need for help comes out of lab with the knowledge of what, how, and why something works. A tutor’s goal is to make sure the student understands the idea, and come out of lab with that knowledge for future endeavors. A tutor, unlike the student, doesn’t just provide the student with the code. They explain step by step of what the student needs to take in order to build the code, clarify any of the student’s confusion, and mention why something works. A tutor’s responsibility is greater than a classmate when helping someone out in lab.",Yes,A,"MW 4:00-5:50p (Lab 2), MW 8:00-9:50p (Lab 7)","I was not sure if it was an error in the application, but I am available for both MW 8-950 morning and night lab.

I enjoy the process of seeing a student slowly work at a problem and find the answer with a little push from some questioning. 
","I went to my math instructor's office hours because I was struggling on sequences and series from integral calculus. I asked questioned and guessed at what I was doing, skipping steps and assuming things from the definitions and theorems. He told me to approach the problems slowly and write out my steps. I learned the concepts I did not understand and also learned that I had to slow down!
","I am not sure how to answer this question, because I feel that a classmate helping and a tutor helping can be quite similar, if the classmate is like a tutor. The approach of a tutor helping someone should be encouraging and understanding. Tutors should not give out the answer, but help through questioning. This way, the student will develop self-confidence as well as learn how to approach bigger and more difficult problems in the future.  A tutor should not be condescending, but inform students when they are going too far in the wrong way (such as when they misunderstand a concept). I do not feel that I understand the approach of a classmate helping someone in lab.

I tutored for every year in high school excluding freshman year--English as a sophomore and Algebra II as a junior and senior. When I tutored for English, I helped students read between the lines and hone their critical thinking skills. I also guided them toward the deeper meaning of a text, never explicitly telling them the answer but making sure they found one in the end. Tutoring for Algebra II was slightly less taxing but enjoyable all the same. I mainly helped students who were stuck on problems by gradually guiding them step-by-step to the answer. I told them which formulas to use and ensured they understood why. I can say that I have tutored enough to the point where I am comfortable with the prospect of teaching others.","It was not imaginably one moment I have experienced in my high school career that I was able to do well in AP Calculus AB, but many. I had constantly struggled in the class and scored a C-average on my assessments, and while she assured me that a 70 percent was equivalent to a 90 percent on the AP exam, it did little to comfort me when I had thoughts of a C grade in the class tremendously lowering my GPA. I sought my teacher’s help often, even approaching her during our winter and spring breaks. Thankfully, she was an excellent teacher, and with her direction I was able to learn better techniques to solve integrals, which was my weakest topic due to the fact that they required more intuition to figure out. She was stern and blunt by nature, but my constant seeking her help allowed us to bond and eventually lead to her wholehearted support for me. Her teaching skills were one thing that lead to my success in the class, but it was her encouragement that made me believe I could do it in the first place.","Classmates may turn to each other to compare code, to ask a quick question or because they know each other and are more comfortable getting help from a friend. While it is understandable why peers may want to ask each other for help, the right thing to do is to approach a lab tutor. After all, they are there for the purpose of assisting struggling students. Classmates should not be approaching each other for help because they run the risk of writing similar or duplicate code. To prevent this, lab tutors should dutifully approach students that need aid and answer any questions they have. They should help debug students’ codes by guiding them to the answer--not explicitly enough to do the problem for them but not implicitly enough to leave them hanging. If nobody needs help at the moment, tutors should walk around the room and observe the students, occasionally reaching out to them and asking them if they need help. They should be approachable and kind so that students would not be afraid to call them for help. Finally, they should be reachable and attentive; just in case students need help outside of class and e-mail them their questions, they should respond with a good answer in a reasonable time.",Yes,A,MW 4:00-5:50p (Lab 2),,No,,,,No,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,I affirm I have submitted a PDF of my unofficial transcript on Checkmate.,I affirm I have submitted a photo of myself on Checkmate.,"I affirm that the information provided on this application is complete and correct, and any omission or falsification will result in denial of admission or immediate dismissal."

He presented the topic clearly with a practical example who's concept I could directly apply to what I was working on. ","It depends on the classmate, but sometimes when a classmate helps someone in lab, the classmate may give too much away on how to solve a problem. The classmate is a fellow classmate of the person he/she is helping and will sometimes give them a little too much hints to solving the problem. The person who the classmate helped may then be robbed of a learning experience and might still not fully understand the underlying concepts. It's possible tutors can also be this way, but it is less likely since they are formally trained and chosen to help others. A tutor's sole responsibility is to help others and teach them, therefore are more likely to give the person a more formal way of learning the subject in a way that the person being helped will understand the concept better.

In high school, I tutored a wide variety of kids to make some money on the side. Their ages ranged from kindergarten up to 10th grade. I really learned a lot about myself by tutoring these kids from all ages. It really helped me understand how to communicate effectively with people of all ages from all backgrounds. This tutoring sparked my passion for teaching. After taking AP Computer Science in High School, I realized my love for programming. I am now pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Education. I have taught actual classrooms of 3rd graders when taking Phy Sci 5: Introduction to Math/Science Teaching. This class taught me the pedagogy behind teaching math and science to elementary school kids. I believe these experiences have set me up to tutor in ICS.","One moment that sticks like a sore thumb in my memory is from the second grade. We were how to subtract 3-digit and 4-digit numbers. I could not grasp the concept of taking from the tens place and moving a unit to the ones place. My teacher, being the relatable woman she was, knew that I liked Yu-Gi-Oh, so she related the topic to Yu-Gi-Oh and created many problems involving Kaiba losing a certain number of life points. This memory is so special to me because the teacher took the time to get to know me and relate the problem to something I enjoy. Specifically for ICS, I remember having problems understanding using 2-D lists in the Othello game for ICS 32. Throughout the quarter, I heavily relied on the tutors to help me because they were so friendly and I even became friends with them. I called over my trusted mustachioed friend, Jeremy, to help me understand this concept. He basically explained that 2-D arrays are a list of lists. Just like you can have a list of strings or ints, you can have a list of lists. That really helped me out and I fully understood how to proceed in the project from there. ","The approach of a tutor helping someone in a lab is different from the approach of a classmate helping someone because a tutor is coming from a place of experience and wisdom. The tutor has taken and completed the class, while the classmate is still working on his or her project and may be more susceptible to giving wrong information. There is also the risk of the tutor giving too much information and committing an act of academic dishonesty, because they have already taken the class. This is a big concern for me, so whenever I help out my friends, I always write in pseudo-code because I know that even if I've helped them out with the logic of the program, they still have to write it out for themselves.",Yes,N/A,MW 8:00-9:50p (Lab 7),"My ICS 31 grade is still pending, I will send it in as soon as I get it.

Part of what may cause is this is due to the fact that the student who has a working solution to the problem may not entirely understand it still and is unable to give insightful help on how to approach the problem without solving it for the other student. A tutor, on the other hand, would be able to identify the problem in the student's code and perhaps point out why that student's method of approach is not working.
