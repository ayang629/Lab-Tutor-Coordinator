It not only helps other programmers understand and read your code more efficiently, but when a problem arises, you can check what functions are working and what function aren't working instead of checking the entire program line by line. The TA explained that each separate functions is suppose to do one job for your program, and it helped me write my programs in different parts where I used to do everything in one main loop. Writing separate functions also saves the returned value set by a variable if you wish to call it again and use it in a different method. I used to write the same code repeatedly in one loop if I had two objects/variables/values that I wanted to mutate or alter in some way, and the TA explained that writing a separate function on the outside and using it to refer to your variables will save a lot more time and there will be a lot less code to write where I won't mess up. ","The approach of a tutor helping me in lab is different from the approach of a classmate helping me where a classmate just checks if my code works or not, and won't bother telling me how to write my codes more efficiently. A classmate sometimes does not understand the concept of the code and just tells you the answer where as the TA explains the concept and sometimes gives you the answer, or let you figure it out. A classmate generally doesn't help if they can't figure out what is going with your codes and the TA takes their time to help you debug and figure out what is going on.",Yes,"Fall 2013 - B, EECS 12",MWF 4:00-5:50p (Lab 5),,No,,,,No,,,,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,I affirm I have submitted a PDF of my unofficial transcript on Checkmate.,"I affirm that the information provided on this application is complete and correct, and any omission or falsification will result in denial of admission or immediate dismissal.",I affirm I have submitted a photo of myself on Checkmate.

I remember being really frustrated for not understanding kinematics while my classmates around me seem to have the topic fully understood. I went to his office hours for help and thankfully after a while, I was able to understand kinematics and keep up with the class. One thing that I really appreciated from Professor Dennin was his patience in his teaching method; no matter how many times I asked similar questions on topics that he already went over, he did not hesitate on re-teaching me and answering my questions until I understood how different aspects of kinematics worked. His patience relieved my anxiety on not immediately understanding the subject. It helped calmed me down and ultimately help guide me to finally understanding the topic I was completely lost on before.","Even though a tutor and a classmate can both help someone in lab, a tutor should be more professional when approaching the student who is in need of help. A tutor is there for the purpose of helping the students who have questions, so he or she is more prepared to answer questions in lab compared to the classmate who is concurrently taking the class (I am not taking away from the knowledge of the classmate though; the classmate might still have adequate knowledge to answer the questions of someone who is in need of help in lab).",Yes,"Winter 2014- ICS 31, A","MWF 10:00-11:50a (Lab 2 or 7), MWF 2:00-3:50p (Lab 4 or 8)","I want to note that at the moment, there is also still a possibility I can also make either the Lab 3 (MWF 12-150pm) or the Lab 5 time (MWF 4:00-5:50pm).

From 2011 to 2013, I was a private tutor for two students. I taught algebra, geometry  and ACT Math to them.

I am currently tutoring Patrick, a 15-year-old boy with autism and helping him complete physics homework.","In 2013 Fall Quarter, ICS tutors were vital in helping me understand the importance of writing minimum amount of code that accurately performs a specific task. Initially, I focused on writing codes that worked and executed the correct result; these codes tended to be lengthy and inefficient. With the help of tutors, I was able to reduce the length of my code, thereby improving its execution time. The code gradually became shorter and easier to comprehend.","The tutor should be unbiased and always treat everyone equally; he should be professional and respectful at all times. The tutor shouldn't spend too much time on one student and ensure that that everyone gets equal amount of help. Furthermore, he shouldn't simply give away answers or write codes for the student. Instead, he should provide helpful hints and suggestions that will stimulate students' interest and ultimately encourage them to arrive at the solution.
