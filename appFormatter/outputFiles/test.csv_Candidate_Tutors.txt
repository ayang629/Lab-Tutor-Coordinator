Describe a moment...
I received vital help on nearly every lab assigned from TAs and tutors


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
It is certainly a ore professional relationship, and there is perhaps more pressure on the tutor to actually be of some help

-  I was hired by Varsity Tutors in my freshman year to tutor high school kids in English and SAT prep
  I did both virtual and in-person tutoring sessions
-  I tutored students in ICS 31





 while in ICS 31
-  In high school I was asked by my teacher to tutor calculus students


Describe a moment...
I'm friends with the president of ACM, Tim, and he sometimes walks me through algorithms that I don't understand
  We would meet in his office, which had a whiteboard, and he would draw these very clear diagrams of the problem--he was a big fan of picturizing
One time we were solving a problem that was something along the lines of, a robot needs to get from one corner of a grid to another; how many unique ways are there to do so?  He drew the grid and asked me questions about the number of combinations in one direction, and then another direction, and how I would take out repetitive paths
  Usually he waited for a bit before he gave me a hint or a step forward
  I was able to solve the problem, eventually--that was a great feeling!

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
First is the sense of trust and authority a tutor has that a classmate does not
  There's a professionalism that a tutor has to maintain, and one is that a tutor can't just give the answer to the student too quickly
A tutor also understands the larger picture of why a certain method or technique is implemented since they have taken the class before
  They also will have a better sense of design because of that; they should point the student to make fewer mistakes

Describe a moment...
I remember my most helpful tutor was a man named Nelson whom I had for ICS 31
 My TA was unable to explain the concepts and ideas in ways that made sense to me, and the other tutor had a strong accent that made him hard to understand at all
 However Nelson was able to perfectly show me what I needed to do or what I was doing wrong


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor can often be expected to be more knowledgeable about programming concepts than classmates
 Tutors are also expected to help you understand the code while classmates are more expected to simply help get the code working

Prior Experiences?

Describe a moment...
A moment that I've experienced in which a professor was vital in helping me understand a concept was in my compilers course when I was attending the professor's office hours
  After explaining to him the issue I was having in my program on optimization for three-address code, he told me that I could use dynamic-cast to check run-time types
  After this, I continued to work on my assignment, and clarified with him that my approach to the problem was correct, and I got a 100 on the assignment


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
I believe that the tutor should help a student get to the problem themselves while a classmate might just show them their code
  The tutor should guide the student in the right direction, help with compiler errors and answer questions in a way that doesn't give away the solution
  Classmates do not always follow this ideal and sometimes will give away the solution without the student learning or understanding

Prior Experiences?
Yes
 I'm an international student, and I have experience on tutoring my peers(who also wish to study abroad likes me) for their SAT test and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) preparation in China
 I studied and prepared for all these tests in a private educational institution called New Oriental Education
 After I finished all these test, I went back to this institution to assist the teachers to help those examinees
 I helped them to review new words, giving feedback for their oral english testing, and sharing my own test experience to answer their question
 This could be my first experience to assist my peers and tutoring for them
 Tutoring enables me to learn a lot of things that I did not learn when I study by myself; therefore I believe tutoring in ICS lab can be one of the best path to reinforce my programming knowledge


Describe a moment...
When I was a freshman in UCI, I took EECS10 as my first programming class, which is an introduction course to C programming language
 Leaning C is very tough and demanding for beginners, especially when I touch the term "pointer" first time
 One of my tutors told me I can image the pointer is the phone number in a contacts book
 I can find the person directly by his phone number, but a wrong number can trigger serious problem
 Thank to the tutor, I impressively remember the function of point in C programming language


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
a classmate might focus on sharing the lecture note or his own idea to solve the problem as his approach to helping someone in lab, which is more general
 However, a lab tutor needs to help someone solve something not only generally, but also specifically
 For instance, a tutor is usually required to point a small but critical bug for students
 So a tutor's approach should focus on solving detailed and specific problems accurately, and make sure to guide students to have the correct programming idea for specific problem at the same time

I am quite flexible on Monday and Wednesday. I prefer Lab1, 2, 5, 6, 7 more.  
No


Prior Experiences?
I am very familiar with ics 31-33 materials, especially ics 31
 I went through all the lab assignments three times
 My experience of tutoring and teaching would teach ics 31 to few of my friends
 I know a lot about their struggles and mistakes as new programmers
  

Describe a moment...
I remembered the time when I took ics 31
 My lab tutor really helped me fix the not quite obvious bugs
 New programmers always went into certain bugs which they may take hours to fix it
 Tutors would be very helpful in this situation
 They can teach students how to debug themselves, access to the resource on internet and finally help them to fix bugs


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
First, a tutor has to be on time and make himself available to students
 It's his duty to do this
 Second, he has to prepare himself for answering a variety of questions
 Third, he need to spread his time to the whole class
 He needs to make sure everyone gets first aid
 he is not supposed to spend the whole class period with one student
 Also, he should not just give answers to students
 Instead, he should encourage students to solve questions with their own knowledge
 Finally, they should encourage and organize the peer programming

Prior Experiences?
I tutored math in high school for a year

Describe a moment...
I was struggling to understand how to manipulate two dimensional lists and applying it to a game of Othello in ICS 32
 I talked to the lab tutor and he drew up a visual representation of the adjacent coordinates to any given point, and how to reach those coordinates from the original point
 It finally clicked in me on how to solve the problem and ultimately be able to solve a core part of the game logic for Othello


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
The tutor has most likely taken the class before, and knows the logistics of the projects and labs
 An additional point of view from an experienced person holds more weight than a classmate because the classmate may or may not be experienced enough to explain the problem, and may even be wrong

Prior Experiences?
Yes, I used to be a math tutor at Los Angeles Valley College teaching math which included Calculus III and Linear Algebra
 Additionally, I used to to do private tutoring for Computer Science in the languages Java and C++


Describe a moment...
I was struggling in a Differential Equations course
 Worried that I would not pass I went to the school math lab and asked for help
 Luckily I encountered a tutor that had taken Differential Equations the semester prior and they helped explain practically every topic I was confused on
 This tutor ultimately lead to me becoming a math tutor the following semester
 The tutor even helped me so much that I felt comfortable tutoring students in certain Differential Equations topics


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
When tutors help someone in lab they need to ensure that the student completely understands the topic
 This can be done by not directly giving the student the answer but asking questions to guide them in the right direction, allowing the student to solve the problem themselves
 Often times when a classmate helps someone in lab they may just tell the student the answer, robbing the student of a learning opportunity

I would just like to mention, my grade for ICS 31 was pathetic, but I know for a fact that I have a firm understanding of everything this course offers. I know for a fact that if I had the opportunity to retake this course, I would without a doubt, get an A+. As explained before, I'm currently helping my friend who is taking this course. What didn't make sense before makes sense now mainly because of the realization that I was messing up in college during the end of my first year. It's amazing what some dedication and motivation could do to something. I took 45C and got a B+ and I'm taking 46 and currently have an A. So, I would just want you guys to take into consideration that the transition to college was rough, especially for someone who had no programming experience. I have improved drastically and have proved it to myself, but hopefully could prove it to you all.
No


Prior Experiences?
While, it hasn't been an official tutoring service, I used to tutor my peers in high school and actually had a class where I was the TA for the teacher
 I feel like I'm able to help people where they need aid, which is beneficial for them
In college, I'm in a similar situation
 I help my friends in a class that they're struggling with
 It could be anywhere from Math 2A, 2B or even ICS 31, 32, 33
 I'm confident that I know how to tutor in the 30 series


Describe a moment...
When I was in high school, I thought my peer AP Calculus and AP Chemistry
 I was always available to help them since I would benefit from the experience
 I remember an instance where I understood the chain rule when my teacher in high school taught it, but a handful of my friends didn't
 As a result, I would teach them in a classroom that one of my teachers allowed me to borrow during nutrition or lunch
 I would constantly aid my peers in that class that it became a weekly routine, "We're having a quiz on Thursday, so we better make sure we understand the material
 Could you go over some problems Danilo?" By doing that, I gained experience in helping my friends understand the subject
A similar situation happened in college
 When I transitioned to college it was a rough start, but end with my first year, I was confident that I was underperforming and made it my goal to become a better programmer
 It happened through the summer and I'm currently helping my friend in ICS 31 and 32
 Looking back at it, it's completely different, mainly because the class is extremely simple to me now
 Helping my friends out has benefited me since I have a better understanding in Python now
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Well, a classmate may simply give the answer out to someone in lab
 This would ruin the learning experience and I know for a fact that this ruined my experience in ICS 31
 I didn't have the struggle of figuring something out, which drastically impacted me in 32
 A tutor though, would guide the person to the right solution
 Instead of simply giving out the answer, the tutor would explain the process of what does what
 An example would be, a classmate giving someone a lambda function, but the receiver doesn't even understand what a lambda is, but doesn't bother asking for help because it works
 A tutor on the other hand, would explain what a lambda is and guide them on how to write a proper one

Prior Experiences?
No previous experience

Describe a moment...
During one of my labs in my Freshman year, I was having trouble solving one of the problems from a project
 The lab tutor helped by trying to guide me towards the right direction without giving anything away, breaking down the problem step by step
 It was helpful because I was still doing the problem solving/thinking, but the tutor was there to tell me when my approach was wrong
 Seeing how he broke down the first problem into smaller sub-problems also stuck with me and helped me in future projects


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
When asking questions on simple things, such as syntax, the approach is the same
 The approach is different, however, when asking for help on bigger problems
When asking classmates for help, it's usually giving an abstract explanation or general approach of their answer
 While (hopefully) no academic dishonesty is taking place, it is still giving the answer away, although indirectly
 When asking the tutors for help, the tutors guide the person asking for help by asking the question in a different manner or breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and building on that
 In short, the tutors still let the student solve the problem on their own, only helping them by guiding their thought process

Prior Experiences?
I had some tutoring experience in high school
 I was once a TA in the Roman History course, helping the teacher in general and forming review sessions
 I was also the student tutor in the Introductory Computer Science (Photoshop, basic video editing, and some Visual Basic), while helping students in class with specific problems


Describe a moment...
I took the ICS 31 course in 2016 winter quarter, and I remember in one of the lab sessions the TA had help me with the concept of the syntax of the for loop
 In specific, I should've used for [ITEM] in range(len[SOME LIST])) instead of using for [ITEM] in [LIST] for a particular question linking the index and the item itself
 He helped me clear up the confusion of the data type of a for loop to solve that particular kind of problem
 (I first sought help from one of the tutors, but his solution to my particular problem in the code is not sufficient enough, and he found the TA for me
) 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
In general, lab tutors represents for some sort of authority, since they are selected students who are excel in the field of that particular course
 Compared to other classmates, students in a lab section may tend to consult a lab tutor rather than a relatively clever classmate since they may believe that the answer coming from the lab tutor is the most precise, accurate and concise use
 Other than that, lab tutors have more experience encountering questions frequently asked by students
 In this way, the tutors could have a more detailed and thorough explanation for that particular problem, which a classmate may take some time and give some vague answer that may not actually contribute to the problem
 Also, a classmate could just give the codes while the tutors tend to explain how a particular line of codes works

No


Prior Experiences?
Yes, I have worked as a private math tutor for several high school students over the past six months
 I also worked at Kumon Math and Reading for some time


Describe a moment...
Last quarter in ICS 46, I would read lecture notes ahead of time
 Often times however, I felt like I wasn't able to get a strong grasp of the concepts, especially the algorithms
 Seeing the professor graphically hand simulate them on the projector helped me understand them
 I've realized that I learn more efficiently through demonstration and practice compared to just reading text


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
When classmates are helping each other out, they seem to primarily focus on achieving the correct answer and finishing the assignment
 The approach of a tutor should be to encourage the student to think and ensure that the they understand the concept so that If they were to encounter a similar problem they would be able to solve it themselves

No


Prior Experiences?
I have not had any prior experiences in tutoring or teaching


Describe a moment...
During the time I was enrolled in ICS 45C, the tutor was very helpful in one of the lab assignments that involved polymorphism
 Prior to seeking help, I had little knowledge and understanding of what the concept was and how to apply and implement it into code
 The tutor helped develop my understanding and foundations for this particular subject matter by drawing out examples, illustrating the concept with sample code, and helping me give a head start and hint as to how to approach the problem presented in the lab assignment


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Helping a student as a lab tutor is more formal and less flexible than someone who helps another student as a classmate
 As a student having attended many lab sessions hosted by a variety of tutors, I've noticed that as a lab tutor, you can only help students to a certain extent, where you can't give too much away and help students directly with the problem
 As a classmate, it's much more informal where students help each other directly with the problem and code, whereas as a tutor you must restrict yourself from that (except in the case of debugging)
 Also, as a lab tutor you must equally distribute the time you spend on helping students who need assistance
 However, as a classmate you are not limited to this time restriction and are able to give and receive help as many times as you want from another classmate

 I came to the tutor and he explained to me in detail how those thing work and why we have to or dont have to use them
 Since then I was getting so much improve in my programming style


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Tutor is the one that passed the class with an A- or higher so he/she is considering has a good knowledge about the course
 Furthermore, he/she already may encounter the same problem as we may in the future, and overcame it so the tutors will know how to explain it to make people understand

Prior Experiences?
SAT tutoring (paid), Python tutoring (unpaid)

Describe a moment...
In ICS 46 we were talking about the summation of integers 1 to n,   n(n + 1) / 2
  The teacher, realizing that many, including me, did not have a strong math background, drew a visualization for us
  The drawing was of a row of n stacks of tiles with each stack getting higher by 1 each increment, producing a sort of right triangle
 Taking a copy of the shape and flipping it upside-down and combining it with the original shape, we got a n x (n + 1) rectangle
  Thus, the area of the original shape would be n(n + 1) / 2
  This geometric trick has since stuck with me and was a vital way for me to understand the concept and not simply memorize the notation

A tutor generally has more knowledge than a fellow classmate
  Consequently, it is vital that the tutor does not misinform or teach something wrong to the person as this may be difficult to correct
  In contrast, classmates helping each other may make mistakes but can be corrected much more easily
  Additionally, the tutor should focus on aiding understanding of the problem and debugging rather than giving the solution
  A classmate helping someone in lab may tend to focus on finding the solution

As of now (finals week of winter quarter), my grade of ICS 33 has not been released; however, I am positive that I will receive an A (my grade, just without the final exam, is around 98%). I highly prefer to tutor ICS 33 than ICS 32, as I find ICS 33 significantly more interesting and am more confident in my skills and understanding of ICS 33. One concern is I have a class that ends at 12:20 on TuTh; therefore, I am afraid I will be around 20 minutes late to the lab. However, I will compensate this loss with greater and better teaching for students of the lab.*Update: March 25th, after final grades for Winter '16 released:Final grade for ICS 33: A+ (100.2/100)

Prior Experiences?
I currently work as mentor of the International Excellence Program, in which I work as a mentor of twenty international students
 As a mentor, I hold regular office hours, when my mentees can visit freely and ask any questions
 In fall quarter of 2016, I also worked as instructor of AppJam+, in which I taught middle school students how to create android based apps
 And throughout my high school years, I often tutored junior high and elementary students to make myself some allowance
 

Describe a moment...
Tutors are always useful; despite the great professors and amazing lectures, there are some students who ought to lose track on certain concepts
 In these situations, tutors are extremely helpful; and I have experienced my lab tutors helping me throughout ICS 31/32/33


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Lab tutors are more knowledgeable than a classmate in a lab
 In addition, mentors are trained to stimulate the student who needs help to think more of his/her own, whereas a classmate might simply give away the actual code or the answer

Prior Experiences?
I have tutored individuals in varying ages and populations at Irvine Valley College from using excel to programming
 I have tutored writing and math


Describe a moment...
When I went to a math center in my old community college, I was able to clear up a misunderstanding I had with a complicated differential equation
 He was able to point out what step I was clearly doing wrong when simplifying a summation
 The problem was that I was separating the summations of 2 factors into 2 different summations
 In addition to that, the teacher also showed me techniques to solve particular problems, which tremendously helped me understand as well as view the problems in a different perspective


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
I don't think there is a significant difference between a tutor helping someone in the lab as opposed to a classmate helping another because the amount of knowledge required to perform a certain task or write up a specific problem will differ from person to person
 That is, in order for anyone to help one another, the individual who is helping needs to have a confident grasp on data structures
 For instance, the tutor and classmate helper alike need to have a great understanding of implementing iterators based on a queue data structure if a student or fellow classmate is having trouble with != or ++ operator
 In addition to that, they need to have great attention to detail while looking at a person's code because the simplest mistake due to a misconception that could cost the classmate in need of help to spend hours struggling to figure out the error
 Its important to have a strong desire to help others but not write their programs for them as their learning experiences to debug difficult errors would be stripped away from them
 In other words, the students won't learn much if someone else does the work for them

Describe a moment...

It's more formal, and what the tutor says often has more weight behind it because they're expected to know more and better than a classmate

Prior Experiences?
I tutored a C++ course at my junior college


Describe a moment...
There was a moment in ICS32 lab where I was struggling with the concept of recursion and how to implement it properly to solve a problem
 My partner and I called a tutor over, and even though he didn't know how to solve our problem immediately, he was able to break the problem down into smaller parts in front of us until we all knew what was wrong


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
If the classmate knows the concept well-enough, I believe the approach is nearly the same! Yet, ideally the tutor will have a little more experience
 This means that the tutor will be able to better steer the students in the right direction, without giving them the answer

 I was a ping-pong trainer for for children from 7 to 12 years old when I was in high school summer
 I taught them different skills on serving the ball and practicing routine

Describe a moment...
This happened just last week, I'm in ICS 51 this quarter
 The second project is very hard, around 80 students out of 246 didn't get full points for this project
 I still couldn't find the bugs in my work the day before the due day
 So, I made an appointment with Sajjad, who is a TA for this class
 He spent this whole afternoon on Friday taught me that
 He explained it very clearly and patiently
 I appreciated his time so much
 This really impressed me about how teaching can affect a student's attitude to studying
 I felt very involved in this class and I am very willing to do the project right now


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
It is a little bit more academic
 For example, the tutor might use more terms and definitions to explain a question
 In addition, the tutor are more likely to guide a student to solve the problem rather than give out the answer, just like what most of my classmates do
 A tutor who can give a clear guidance and explain with the lecture notes and definitions could be really helpful

Prior Experiences?
In high school, I tutored students in the after school program at Churchill Middle School in math and science
 I worked with various types of students - some who were academically gifted and some who really struggled
 I remember one student in particular who was in the 6th grade, yet struggled to perform simple arithmetic
 Working with him every week was especially challenging because he struggled to focus, his thoughts wandered, and often times he was more interested in telling me about his video games than finishing his homework
 On the days that I wasn't there, he usually never did his homework, but when I was there to help him, he could actually get some of his homework done, which was almost a miracle for this student
 Working with him and the fact that he looked forward to seeing me every week was probably the most rewarding part of tutoring at Churchill
 Because I was also a member of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), I would teach workshops at Churchill about business, entrepreneurship, and personal finance in a fun and interactive way (mostly through mock game shows)
 I competed at the national level for FBLA in the personal finance competition, and so I really wanted to share my knowledge with those around me
 I believe it's never too early to start learning about topics like that
 Whenever I gave these workshops I was always astounded at the level of student engagement
 Because of this, I have realized that I can learn so much about something and get better at it by teaching it, and so I want to apply that idea to my computer science education by tutoring


Describe a moment...
There are many instances in my academic career when I struggled to understand or do something, whether it was kinematics, calculus, or writing Chinese characters
 One subject that I had a hard time grasping in particular was a philosophy class I had to take in high school called the Theory of Knowledge (TOK)
 I struggled in TOK because philosophy is not as concrete as the other subjects we study in high school
 In that class, we often had to talk about the various ways in which we come to know what we know, and the different areas of knowledge that exist
 To me, this was all very confusing, until I asked my teacher how knowledge is exactly defined
 He then explained to me that knowledge is a justified true belief, so for something to be knowledge, somebody had to believe it, be able to justify it, and show that it was true
 By breaking down the definition of knowledge for me, he took something that seemed very abstract and turned it into something I could understand
 TOK was one of the most eye opening classes I have ever taken, thanks to the teacher I had
 Once I had a working, concrete definition of knowledge, I understood the different areas of knowledge a whole lot better, and came to realize that there is more than one way of knowing and acquiring knowledge
 Whenever I learn about something new, whether it's coding or history or mathematics, I always think about the different ways of acquiring knowledge that exist, and how those different ways benefit people with various learning styles
 Some people learn better by reading, some by listening, and some by having others explain a topic to them, and that is something I am cognizant of and accommodating for when I am tutoring


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Before I came to UCI and took ICS 31, I had programming experience in Python
 Because of this, my skill level tended to be a bit higher than that of my partners', and so whenever they were having trouble understanding something, I took the time to explain exactly what each line of code does
 Whenever there was a bug in our program, I almost always was able to identify the problem and fix it
 However, many people in ICS 31 take the class with no prior programming experience, so often times, partners cannot thoroughly and accurately explain how and why each line of code does what it does, and might not be able to identify what is causing errors in the program right away
 Because of the frustration this can cause for new programmers, a classmate or lab partner might be tempted to simply tell someone what to type and move on without explaining why
 I believe that a lab tutor should take a different approach
 If a lab tutor helps someone find a bug or fix an error, they should explain why that error was happening and then guide the student to a solution, instead of simply telling them what to type and then walking away
 Essentially, a lab tutor should not do the work for the student, but work with the student to help with what they need and be able to explain code thoroughly and accurately, as well as answer any questions the student has about python programming in general

No


Prior Experiences?

 Still, I have had much experience with explaining concepts to class mates throughout the years
 In addition, I am nearly fluent in Italian and often speak with native Italian speakers trying to learn English
 I offer them advice for saying phrases more concisely and correct their grammar
 I enjoy explaining concepts to them and feel I have a knack for it


Describe a moment...
Gregor Urban, lab tutor from ICS-33, helped me understand how an object looks up its method
 I recall having a vague understanding of how the process worked after reading the professors notes, but working through with him call by call really cleared things up and help me see it was not as complicated as I had originally thought
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
For starters, a tutor is supposed to be an expert on the material, or at the very least proficient
 A classmate in most cases would not be as knowledgeable of the material as the tutor
 The fundamental difference however, is that a tutor, having learned the material already, tries to find ways to explain in an understandable fashion
 A classmate might not endeavor to think of new ways to understand/explain the material so long as he/her/self understand the material
 Lastly, students should feel trusting of their tutors whereas they may tend to doubt a classmate's advice

 Now she seemed to be able to finish project 5 by herself (I hope)
For other friends, I helped them in stuffs like: debugging, algorithm in board games, organizing the code and big pictures of the project itself


Describe a moment...
There is one guy in 31, he used a really good example to illustrate that if I want to modify a list in python, I have to use indexing
 This really helped me a lot in ICS 31


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
I believe tutors should have prior experience of that course, so they actually know what they are doing
 classmates however, they are all struggling through the projects, they probably can help each other, but not as good as getting help from tutors

As a 3rd year computer science I would really like to retain all I have learned about python while tutoring for one of the courses that I really enjoyed. The projects in ICS 33 were one of the most interesting one's that I would have no trouble explaining to other students. 
No


Prior Experiences?
I do not have any official experience teaching in a classroom setting however I have had the opportunity to utilize what I have learned to help out my fellow friends in similar classes
 Throughout my ICS classes I tried my best to learn all the material and get every assignment done before the deadlines
 Since I finished most material early, if any of my colleagues needed assistance I would lend a helping hand
 I would really try to help others understand the concepts
 As well as helping friends of the same year, some underclassmen have come to me for help and i'd like to say I was able to help them a lot
 

Describe a moment...
ICS tutors are vital in helping me with almost every project
 Although I try my best to understand the material myself, there are multiple times in which I am unable to figure out how to proceed in my projects
 Whenever this happens, TA's and tutors are very helpful in not only helping me get past the problem but they also make me understand why a certain problem existed and understand the process to fix it
 Some tutors even take out paper and help me visualize my code in an attempt to make me understand
 A specific moment is when I tried to finish my Othello code in ICS 32, the tutor stayed with me for quite a while and drew an othello board on paper to help me understand the concept of how to place a piece on the tkinter board
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
When a tutor helps a student with code they already should have the solutions to many of the problems students face, so they are able to help a student come up with a solution while teaching the student
 However when a fellow classmate helps, they need to work together to find the solution which may be take more time
 As well as there is no certainty that the classmates solution is correct
 Tutors are more able to provide valuable help to students but still keep provides students with a comfortable atmosphere seeing as tutors were once taking the same course

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor assisting someone in lab is different from a classmate helpingsomeone because when tutors will most likely be more professional than aclassmate
 In addition, tutors will have more experience with the project that the students are working on, so they may be	able to provide more assistance

Prior Experiences?
I have not had any recent experiences tutoring or teaching as a student at UCI but I did tutor French 1, 2, and 3 when I was a senior in high school


Describe a moment...
When I took my introductory Python classes at UCI, I was very scared because I had no prior experience like many students and felt as though I would not be able to keep up with the assignments and material even if I read the textbook and did exercises along the way
 Thankfully, the TA and tutors I had were very approachable and friendly, going over things in depth that I did not understand and were very understanding with any additional questions I would have during the assistance
 That helped me become gradually more confident in programming and reduced anxieties I would have during timed exams where I was on my own


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
I believe a classmate helping a fellow person in lab generally has a quick and casual approach since the two are usually on the same level, working on the same assignment
 There is the high possibility that the answer can be given to help the other party move on to the next step with the absence of thorough reasoning or understanding
 On the other hand, a tutor should see the situation as an opportunity to contribute to the person's learning by helping them work towards the solution through explaining, clarifying and additionally giving examples
 This way, the student can reinforce the concept or lesson into their learning and recall it for future use such as on later assignments and exams

Describe a moment...
In both ICS 46 (Data Structure Implementation and Analysis with Professor Alex Thornton) and CS 161 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms with Professor David Eppstein), the material was very difficult
 My saving graces in the two classes were discussion and lab, where the help of the TA and tutors benefitted greatly
 It is hard to appreciate and understand the helpfulness of a tutor until you actually need the help and seek it
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
When helping a classmate, I am usually their friend and taking the class with them, resulting in a laid-back approach
 If the material is difficult, it is okay for me to not understand it and for me to figure it out along the way with them
 I can also joke and have fun during the process
 However, as a lab tutor, I'm expecting that I need to be more professional and not knowing the material is not an option
 I should be able to answer any questions and provide help in a timely and prepared fashion

 Usually I didn't need help but when it came to writing Othello I was stuck
 The TA in the lab really helped me understand how to write the algorithm for determining the valid moves on the board
 Overall the tutor was really helpful in helping me understand how to work with different parts of the python standard library and how recursion works
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor is more inclined to want to help other students learn, while a classmate might be more inclined to stick to themselves
 Also a tutor has already gone through the course so they have a higher chance of better understanding the concepts that might trip up students
 While a classmate may not necessarily explain concepts as well as someone who knows it pretty well

The tutor's role is to help the student figure out the solution to their problem themselves, while a classmate may give a more direct answer or share how their own code operates

I am willing to tutor other C++ classes that are prerequisites for ICS 46, but ICS 46 is the only class I have taken at UCI, and is my preferred class to tutor.
No


Prior Experiences?
I tutored at Saddleback College for the following courses: Introduction to Computer Science I & II & III(C++), Data Structures (C++)

Describe a moment...
In nearly every CS class I have taken, I have come across a concept or bug that I do not fully understand, at which point a teacher or tutor has become vital to helping me understand
 One example was in ICS 46: It was my first time owning a Mac, and I ran into several issues because of this
 In program #5, I was having trouble reading input from the 
txt file because of the line termination
 This is something I was completely unfamiliar with, so without the help of someone with more computer experience, I would not have known that PC's use a carriage return followed by a line feed, compared to the mac way of just line feed


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor should instruct students on concepts, algorithms, and syntax, that the student may use to resolve an issue with their code, or come up with a solution to the problem
 Although it is sometimes necessary to view their code, a tutor should not offer a solution or code relevant to the homework
  A classmate will be working on the same assignment, and may violate the academic honesty policy by helping the student if they view code or offer a solution

Prior Experiences?
Yes, I was previously a tutor at my community college
 I tutored calculus, multivariable calculus, physics newtonian, physics electromagnetism, and chemistry


Describe a moment...
I started tutoring at my community college because I saw how much it was helping me progress in my classes
 I recall when I was learning Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism I was having trouble wrapping my head around Maxwellâ€“Faraday equation
 When I went to the lab Chris, the tutor, was monumental in helping my not only understand the concept but be able to visualize what was happening
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Being a tutor for a subject, you need to be able to see the issue the individual is having and be able to enlighten them with the right questions to put them on the path to a solution
 Where when helping a classmate many times one isn't so concerned in asking the right questions but more in just giving the solution
 This is not an option as a tutor, the tutor is there to better help the students learn concepts and help them pass road blocks they may be having

No


Prior Experiences?
I have acted as a tutor and a mentor in the past for my high school's robotics program


Describe a moment...
Fall quarter when I first took ICS 51, I got lost in much of the concepts in how memory and assembly instructions were connected, and so one day I went into office hours
 When Professor Alfaro drew everything out for me in a sequence that connected everything, the concepts of Computer Organization were less fragmented and I saw how everything came together


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
I feel like a tutor helping someone involves encouraging someone to make a decision in a certain direction, with a little bit of guidance
 This is possible because they are usually more aware of the varying ways to approach a solution
 Alternatively, a classmate helping someone in lab is in an immediate situation where they often only understand how they solved a problem, and will mostly provide a step by step process in how to approach a solution in the same way that they did it, often times giving too much information that takes away from someone's learning experience

Prior Experiences?
When I was in high school, I was part of a group of students called peer leaders
 As a peer leader, I was responsible for tutoring several special education students and college preparatory students
 Each tutoring experience was one-on-one, so I was able to develop intimate bonds with each of my students
 I also did not tutor these students in a specific subject because they all struggled in different aspects of school
 Because of this, I had to adapt to each student and brush up on multiple subjects, such as English, precalculus, chemistry, etc
 I also had to think on my feet just in case a student may want to work on something else


Describe a moment...
A teacher that I will never forget is my high school sophomore English Honors teacher, Mrs
 Wenzell
 I thought that I came into Mrs
 Wenzellâ€™s class with a basic understanding of English literature how to write literary analysis essays
 After getting back a grade of a D- on my first essay, I realized that I had a long way to go before being able to write concise and thoughtful essays
 I also realized that reading was one of my weak points in academia
 Throughout the school year, Mrs
 Wenzell taught me how to think critically by discussing various perspectives of the books we read in class
 This was by far the most challenging class I have taken as a student in K-12 education because it demanded a lot of time and thinking outside the box
 Through one-on-one mentorship and classroom discussions, Mrs
 Wenzell helped me build a foundation for active reading and for writing thought-provoking college-level essays
 Her teachings were crucial to how I write today, and more importantly, how I comprehend everything in life


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Tutors are expected to allocate an equal amount of time toward every student that needs help while a classmate can solely focus on a friend that needs his or her help
 In terms of writing programs, tutors have the responsibility of debugging programs in case students have immense trouble on a particular problem
 They also have the responsibility of helping students understand why code works, rather than just making code work
 Classmates may help each other get by, but tutors establish a foundation for students to build on for their future success

No


Prior Experiences?
No formal experience tutoring, only helping fellow classmates


Describe a moment...
During one of the labs, I had trouble with assembly
 One of the TA's explained to me the inner working of what I was trying to accomplish
 After this explanation I understood not only what to do but exactly what that was doing at a deep level


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor offers a more professional level of help and generally has seen the material before and has had time to prepare
 This deeper level of understanding offers a more complete perspective of the material when answering questions

No
 But I often explain stuff to my classmates if I understand the concepts talked in classes
 Most of my friend think I'm pretty good at explaining


Describe a moment...
Two weeks ago when I was doing program 4 for ICS 46
 The deadline was approaching and I had no idea why the test for large scale fails while other test works
 Then TA Igor helped me finding the error -- turns out I should not check the value of trailer because it is a random value
 I learned a lot about how to  debug my code and find where the errors is during this time


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Classmate usually discuss problems and figure out a way to solve it together
 A tutor is more like a teacher in the way of helping students in lab
 A good tutor should quickly find out the problem and succinctly explain it

Prior Experiences?
I have a younger sister that has looked for me for help since middle school
 I've helped tutor her in math and science classes, studying with her and testing her on concepts and vocabulary
 Since I've taken all the classes that she is taking, just as I will have already taken the ICS classes that I would be tutoring for, I already knew and understood the concepts
 Outside of academics, I was an assistant teacher for ballet classes and a softball team
 For the ballet classes I helped teach ballet to 6-7 year olds, making sure that they understood what the steps are and that they were paying attention
 In softball, I was an assistant coach for a season where I helped train 14U softball players
 In both cases, I've had years of experience in the sport and assisted the teachers in improving their players/dancers
 I made sure that they were using correct forms and corrected any mistakes
 

Describe a moment...
In high school, I had trouble producing clean, concise papers in writing
 It would take many drafts for me to submit something that was strong enough to earn a high score
 In my senior year, my writing teacher allowed students to come in after class and work on improving their papers for a higher grade
 Unlike most students, I took that opportunity to not only raise my grade, but also figure out how to improve my writing skills
 When I came in, she went over what went wrong in my paper and started a discussion on how to improve it
 Although she didn't tell me what to write or what to talk about, the way she lead the discussion helped me realize what to think about when I'm looking at a prompt
 She helped guide my thinking to get to the right answer
 A couple papers later, after coming in more times and getting more feedback, I was able to produce a well-written paper in class that received a high score
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
First off, the tutor has most likely already taken the course or dealt with the problems being asked
 Their experience makes them more knowledgeable than a fellow classmate
 Although a classmate may have already figured the answer out or known it from past coding, a tutor comes in with a different perspective; they aren't there to code the entire project, they are there to look at pieces that aren't working
 If you ask a classmate that is working on the same lab, they are looking at it with the perspective if it works with their code, they are going to want to solve the problem in context of their code, compared to a tutor who isn't writing code for the project

Describe a moment...
When I take ICS 53 which main using C programming language, the concept of pointer is confusing me a lot, there is a lab tutor who explain it in great depth and run the program fragment as example to illustrate his explanation
 I pretty appreciate he help me understand the concept of pointer and be very patient, which pretty impressive


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
The main difference is the ways to help, for example, the classmate may just give briefly explanation or even answers, however, as a TA, it is their responsibilities to walk the student through the concept of the question use and direct the students to find the answers by their own, now just give them answers
