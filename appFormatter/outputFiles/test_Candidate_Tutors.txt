Prior Experiences?
The only prior experience I have had tutoring was recently for my mother's friend at her work
 They are both nurses, and hospitals in California are having nurses go back to school to earn their Bachelor's degrees
 So, I helped my mother's friend with her Beginning Algebra class
 I explained how to graph in R^2, how to factor polynomials, etcetera
 She got an A in the class and will be taking College Algebra the next term


Describe a moment...
It must have been week 5 of my first quarter at UCI, and I had no prior experience in programming, let alone Python
 Things such as dot-methods, conditionals, and loops within loops heavily confused me
 I was barely getting by
 And in lab one day, a lab tutor came over to me, and he explained specifics in Layman's terms to me
 He went line-by-line with me explaining how one things leads to another
 Inner loops, conditionals, and dot-methods made much more sense afterwards, and I could actually code much more of my projects without my partners having to take control
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Well, classmates may not always be the most useful resource
 Lab tutors have taken the class before, and they have done the work; they have been in our shoes
 A classmate may just give one the answer without much context, but a lab tutor will sit down with one and go line-by-line until one understands what they are working with
 Basically, more clarity can be given with context by a lab tutor, while it is not necessarily a classmate's responsibility to explicitly teach one what one does not understand

Prior Experiences?
I have not had any prior experience tutoring or teaching formally, but I have helped classmates with their class work
 When I teach others how to do something, it motivates me like no other motivator to learn the material I'm teaching
 It motivates me to be a reliable teacher and provide the best help possible


Describe a moment...
Once in ICS 45C, I was having trouble understanding how to implement a hash map
 I went to the lab section for the class and a tutor illustrated on the white board the concept of a hash map
 Understanding this concept was crucial to the completion of the project and the tutor helped me clear the roadblock I was facing in doing the project
 He presented the topic clearly with a practical example who's concept I could directly apply to what I was working on
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
It depends on the classmate, but sometimes when a classmate helps someone in lab, the classmate may give too much away on how to solve a problem
 The classmate is a fellow classmate of the person he/she is helping and will sometimes give them a little too much hints to solving the problem
 The person who the classmate helped may then be robbed of a learning experience and might still not fully understand the underlying concepts
 It's possible tutors can also be this way, but it is less likely since they are formally trained and chosen to help others
 A tutor's sole responsibility is to help others and teach them, therefore are more likely to give the person a more formal way of learning the subject in a way that the person being helped will understand the concept better

Prior Experiences?
I have helped my friend on computer science class
 Also, I'm a STEM mentor at Mathobotix right


Describe a moment...
My most memorial experience is when I helped my friend explain about class definition
 I need to simple concept so he can understand it easily
 At that moment, I came up with a good example that help me remember and understand the concept clearly


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
My opinion is that I can't give out the answer immediately
 Instead, when helping someone in lab, I need make sure that understand the concept so they can apply it to problem

Prior Experiences?
Yes
 I am used to teaching Computer Science topics to my peers


Describe a moment...
Pattis was very vital in teaching the concept of linked lists to me, as he simulated the data structure with code as well as a picture simulation
 I believe these are two crucial ways to teach Computer Science


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A classmate can have a biased approach toward helping
 I think it is easier to teach as a tutor, as it is easier to force the student to think about the answers themselves

Describe a moment...
In my high school computer science class, my teacher was helpful to all of us in understanding the programming concepts we were learning, and took time to help us individually
 She helped me understand something to do with if statements as I was programming a robot


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A classmate has his own work to attend to
 A tutor's sole purpose is to help anyone in need, and to be ready to help anyone in any capacity
 More importantly, a tutor has the time to make ensure that the one they are helping understands the concepts

		MW 4:00-5:50p (Lab 2)
Additional information listed:
Nothing listed

Prior Experiences?
Yes
 I tutored for every year in high school excluding freshman year--English as a sophomore and Algebra II as a junior and senior
 When I tutored for English, I helped students read between the lines and hone their critical thinking skills
 I also guided them toward the deeper meaning of a text, never explicitly telling them the answer but making sure they found one in the end
 Tutoring for Algebra II was slightly less taxing but enjoyable all the same
 I mainly helped students who were stuck on problems by gradually guiding them step-by-step to the answer
 I told them which formulas to use and ensured they understood why
 I can say that I have tutored enough to the point where I am comfortable with the prospect of teaching others


Describe a moment...
It was not imaginably one moment I have experienced in my high school career that I was able to do well in AP Calculus AB, but many
 I had constantly struggled in the class and scored a C-average on my assessments, and while she assured me that a 70 percent was equivalent to a 90 percent on the AP exam, it did little to comfort me when I had thoughts of a C grade in the class tremendously lowering my GPA
 I sought my teacher’s help often, even approaching her during our winter and spring breaks
 Thankfully, she was an excellent teacher, and with her direction I was able to learn better techniques to solve integrals, which was my weakest topic due to the fact that they required more intuition to figure out
 She was stern and blunt by nature, but my constant seeking her help allowed us to bond and eventually lead to her wholehearted support for me
 Her teaching skills were one thing that lead to my success in the class, but it was her encouragement that made me believe I could do it in the first place


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Classmates may turn to each other to compare code, to ask a quick question or because they know each other and are more comfortable getting help from a friend
 While it is understandable why peers may want to ask each other for help, the right thing to do is to approach a lab tutor
 After all, they are there for the purpose of assisting struggling students
 Classmates should not be approaching each other for help because they run the risk of writing similar or duplicate code
 To prevent this, lab tutors should dutifully approach students that need aid and answer any questions they have
 They should help debug students’ codes by guiding them to the answer--not explicitly enough to do the problem for them but not implicitly enough to leave them hanging
 If nobody needs help at the moment, tutors should walk around the room and observe the students, occasionally reaching out to them and asking them if they need help
 They should be approachable and kind so that students would not be afraid to call them for help
 Finally, they should be reachable and attentive; just in case students need help outside of class and e-mail them their questions, they should respond with a good answer in a reasonable time

Major: Physics
Interested Classes:
	ICS31 (N/A)
		TuTh 2:00-3:50p (Lab 1), MW 8:00-9:50p (Lab 7)
Additional information listed:
I believe I have enough passion, responsibility and skills to be a lab tutor. I have additional knowledge in C and Java, and experience with various platforms including Windows, Mac OS and some with Unix under Terminal. I think these skills will be useful in labs as well.


Prior Experiences?
No

Describe a moment...
When I took Prof
 Kay's Python Class, he answered my question in his office hour with the concept on C and Java which I had experienced with
 Since then I realized that the core and leading ideas of programming languages are the same
 I believe these ideas are much more important than how skillful your are with a language


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
You have to be professional and responsible for the questions received
 Before each lab section, you as a tutor should finish reading the whole assignment and figure out the methods and critical points needed
 During the lab you have to analyze and troubleshoot the problems for students' code
 If your student is non-major, you have to explain with the simplest and most concise languages

However, helping others as a classmate does not need to be these well prepeared

Additional information listed:
I had applied for tutoring last quarter. I had submitted my unofficial transcript and my photograph on checkmate. Do i need to submit it again? Right now checkmate is showing that all my requirements are fulfilled. 


Prior Experiences?
Yes, I have tutored a lot of my fellow mates in my high school
 Also, I have tutored my juniors time and again whenever my professor asked me to do so
 In addition to this, I have assisted my professor for various lectures and made power point presentations for him


Describe a moment...
In all my ICS 31 and 32 classes, my tutors and TA's played a vital role in helping me understand concepts that acted us a hurdle in any lab assignment
 They broadened my thinking by giving me hints about the problem rather than solving it for me
 This eventually improved my coding abilities


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor hints the student to do the problem
 He gives the student a path to reach to the final stage, while on the other hand, a fellow classmate will help the other student by telling him the solution to the problem
 The base is well built when the student himself thinks about the solution to the problem rather than knowing the answer and then solving the problem

I was not sure if it was an error in the application, but I am available for both MW 8-950 morning and night lab. (It said it was a night lab on the application)

For Lab 1 (TuTh 2-350p), I put down I was not available for it because of ICS 193 (tutoring lecture). However, if there is a chance that I am excused from the class then I will be available to tutor for Lab 1.

I would prefer to be in Lab 2, but I wouldn't mind being in the other labs.
I am currently taking ICS 32 for Winter Quarter 2015.


Prior Experiences?
One of my first experiences tutoring involved helping my little sister out in her homework
 At home, I guided her through homework from math, English, and religion
 In addition to homework, I made sure she was thoroughly prepared before important exams when my mom was not there to help out
 These experiences taught me the value of making sure the tutee not just gets the answer, but understands the answer
 Because my sister was only in primary school, I knew it was crucial that she masters the material so that she would have a good base for future learning


During my senior year of high school, I became one of the teaching assistants for the ROP Video Production class
 As a TA, I helped students out in any technical issues or general questions concerning the video project they were working on
 After having previous knowledge in the software the class worked with (Adobe Premiere Pro), I was required to provide aid to any students who were confused with a certain tool in the program


Describe a moment...
Before the AP Calculus exam, I sought tutoring from my teacher Hedlund
 At first, I only cared about the answer to a problem than figuring out how to tackle through it
 However, Hedlund taught me a valuable tool in improving a skill or learning something new: attention to detail
 He made me look into every little element before doing a calculus problem such as writing down variables and creating a diagram than just tackling the question head on
 It was through this that I understood the concept of thinking ahead and breaking a problem down into small pieces before actually doing it
 Hedlund not only helped me successfully pass the AP Calculus test, but provided me an approach on how to solve future complex problems in other subjects


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
As a classmate helping someone out in lab, one cares more about providing them with the solution to the problem
 Classmates are more worried about getting the concept themselves than others understanding it
 When a peer helps another peer out, the ultimate goal is to provide a quick solution and then go back to their own problems in the lab
 For example, a classmate may just provide the student a part of code that allows the student in need to move forward
 The student was provided help, but may not have fully understood what was going on or why it worked


In contrast, the approach of giving support as a tutor involves making sure the person in need fully grasps the concept you are trying to teach
 Being a tutor, you are almost an extension of the professor and a source of aid for the student
 With that responsibility, a tutor must make sure that the student in need for help comes out of lab with the knowledge of what, how, and why something works
 A tutor’s goal is to make sure the student understands the idea, and come out of lab with that knowledge for future endeavors
 A tutor, unlike the student, doesn’t just provide the student with the code
 They explain step by step of what the student needs to take in order to build the code, clarify any of the student’s confusion, and mention why something works
 A tutor’s responsibility is greater than a classmate when helping someone out in lab

Describe a moment...
In my High School AP Computer Science class, the instructor had a mastery of the material and presented me with an interesting and challenging style that really made me enjoy the subject and made me want to pursue it further
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
The tutor has already taken the class and knows the expectations of the professor
 Therefore, the tutor is able to review and provide the lab's expectations

I find it amazing how much we learn from teaching. 

Thank you for your time!


Prior Experiences?
I have tutored students to prepare them for the AP Computer Science exam, and I had a lot of fun
 I enjoy the process of seeing a student slowly work at a problem and find the answer with a little push from some questioning
 


Describe a moment...
I went to my math instructor's office hours because I was struggling on sequences and series from integral calculus
 I asked questioned and guessed at what I was doing, skipping steps and assuming things from the definitions and theorems
 He told me to approach the problems slowly and write out my steps
 I learned the concepts I did not understand and also learned that I had to slow down!


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
I am not sure how to answer this question, because I feel that a classmate helping and a tutor helping can be quite similar, if the classmate is like a tutor
 The approach of a tutor helping someone should be encouraging and understanding
 Tutors should not give out the answer, but help through questioning
 This way, the student will develop self-confidence as well as learn how to approach bigger and more difficult problems in the future
  A tutor should not be condescending, but inform students when they are going too far in the wrong way (such as when they misunderstand a concept)
 I do not feel that I understand the approach of a classmate helping someone in lab

Prior Experiences?
I was a TA for geometry in high school


Describe a moment...
Whenever I'm unable to get a project started, or when I don't know how to approach a task, a tutor generally was around to help me get the ball rolling


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor is more about getting the ball rolling when it is stuck, providing small concepts or providing a task list in order to get through situations
 Whereas a classmate is more likely to roll the ball themselves, providing the direct answer

I was a TA for geometry in my senior year of high school


Describe a moment...
Whenever I struggled to begin a project, I always asked a tutor and they would give me some concepts to get the ball rolling

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor is more about helping to get the ball rolling without actually revealing any of the answers
 This is different from a classmate, who may reveal the answers along the way

 My initial attempt was really off and the tutor helps put me on the right track and I was able to complete the rest of the assignment with ease
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Tutor gives hints on how to do a problem while classmate usually gives the answer
 By just giving the answer, you will rob that person's chance to fully understand the material

Prior Experiences?
Yes I have
 I have tutored math from Algebra to Caculus single variable in Math Resources Center at Pasadena City College
 I also have applied to be a lab tutor for ICS before
However, I couldn't meet up for the ICS 193, so I decided not to tutor last year
 

Describe a moment...
I was struggling in finding out a solution to a simple short coding assignment because I analyzed the problem too much
 I look at some irrelevant information or misread the problem
 Therefore, I ended up solving a problem in a very long and inefficient way
 I asked the tutor
 He was very helpful in breaking down the problems, giving necessary help for me to solve the problem on my own
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A tutor tend to know the materials better
 They have better understanding of the materials and can offer you a different perspective on the materials or the solution to the problem
 A classmate is also helpful but he/she will lack the knowledge of giving you a clear explanation on certain concepts

My ICS 45C grade is still pending because I just retook the class, I will send it in as soon as I get it. I hope my previous grade does not effect my selection because I learned a lot this quarter and feel that I am an expert in C++ now. My schedule is also still pending because I am on the waitlist for a few classes and my manager has not published my work schedule yet. I will be more available once my schedule is solidified.
I am very excited to be a tutor this upcoming quarter!


Prior Experiences?
Yes, I have had a few prior experience tutoring and teaching
 In high school, I tutored a wide variety of kids to make some money on the side
 Their ages ranged from kindergarten up to 10th grade
 I really learned a lot about myself by tutoring these kids from all ages
 It really helped me understand how to communicate effectively with people of all ages from all backgrounds
 This tutoring sparked my passion for teaching
 After taking AP Computer Science in High School, I realized my love for programming
 I am now pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Education
 I have taught actual classrooms of 3rd graders when taking Phy Sci 5: Introduction to Math/Science Teaching
 This class taught me the pedagogy behind teaching math and science to elementary school kids
 I believe these experiences have set me up to tutor in ICS


Describe a moment...
One moment that sticks like a sore thumb in my memory is from the second grade
 We were how to subtract 3-digit and 4-digit numbers
 I could not grasp the concept of taking from the tens place and moving a unit to the ones place
 My teacher, being the relatable woman she was, knew that I liked Yu-Gi-Oh, so she related the topic to Yu-Gi-Oh and created many problems involving Kaiba losing a certain number of life points
 This memory is so special to me because the teacher took the time to get to know me and relate the problem to something I enjoy
 Specifically for ICS, I remember having problems understanding using 2-D lists in the Othello game for ICS 32
 Throughout the quarter, I heavily relied on the tutors to help me because they were so friendly and I even became friends with them
 I called over my trusted mustachioed friend, Jeremy, to help me understand this concept
 He basically explained that 2-D arrays are a list of lists
 Just like you can have a list of strings or ints, you can have a list of lists
 That really helped me out and I fully understood how to proceed in the project from there
 

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
The approach of a tutor helping someone in a lab is different from the approach of a classmate helping someone because a tutor is coming from a place of experience and wisdom
 The tutor has taken and completed the class, while the classmate is still working on his or her project and may be more susceptible to giving wrong information
 There is also the risk of the tutor giving too much information and committing an act of academic dishonesty, because they have already taken the class
 This is a big concern for me, so whenever I help out my friends, I always write in pseudo-code because I know that even if I've helped them out with the logic of the program, they still have to write it out for themselves

I am not sure if a 100*100 Pixel photo is what you are looking for because it seems too small for me.


Prior Experiences?
Not in Universities


Describe a moment...
When I first learned programming with Python, I found it difficult to read the documentation of Python Libraries
 Then I asked the TA in ICS-31 and he illustrated how to effectively read the documentation
 He showed me that if I am only interesting the functionality of a function I should only look at that specific part of the documentation rather than reading the whole page


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Tutor is more of authority and responsibility
 A classmate helps you only when he or she has time because it is not that person's responsibility to help you out
 However, a tutor would try really hard to help you out because being a tutor is about responsibilities and helping the others

Prior Experiences?
In high school, I was part of a tutoring club for three years
 I tutored students in grades 1-10 in writing, math, and reading
 Though much of the tutoring focus was on math as that was the subject I preferred to tutor on
 I was also a teaching assistant at a Kumon Learning Center for two years and focused on helping students improve their math, reading, and independent study skills
 

Describe a moment...
When I was first learning linked lists in ICS 33, the concept was difficult for me to understand since Python never formally introduced the concept of pointers
 I visited Professor Pattis for help on how linked lists after not being able to understand the example he did in class
 When it came to helping me understand, he first clarified what a linked list was before walking me through an example
 But rather than just writing it on the board for me, Professor Pattis had me draw the diagram that corresponded to the example he showed in class
 By having me draw it with his guidance, it made it much more clear to me what was going in the example
 And by going to his office hours, the help I received made the example much more memorable


How is a tutor different from a classmate?
A classmate will usually point to what the answer is and give the student that is asking for help the answer which takes away from the learning
 Part of what may cause is this is due to the fact that the student who has a working solution to the problem may not entirely understand it still and is unable to give insightful help on how to approach the problem without solving it for the other student
 A tutor, on the other hand, would be able to identify the problem in the student's code and perhaps point out why that student's method of approach is not working
 The tutor does not give away the solution but helps the student identify the problem and leads them onto the right path
 Doing so, the tutor ensures that the learning is still happening for the student

Prior Experiences?
No, I do not have any prior experiences tutoring or teaching
 

Describe a moment...
When they used examples to describe a conceptual concept, I had better understanding
 For example, when I read the power point for ics51, I could not understand the concepts since it did not have much detail, and the concepts were too abstract for me
 I felt that I had to go to lecture to listen to what the professor said because he did give examples and draw graphs when he was teaching
   

How is a tutor different from a classmate?
Tutor will give immediate responses to the students when they have questions or get stuck
 Tutor has token the class before so he/she knows more things about the lab than classmate
 
It is hard to help if someone could not look at the code
 However, for students, it is not good to look at other people's code
